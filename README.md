# ActiveDirectoryTester
Just a few samples how to work with ActiveDirectory on the local machine. 
It's a small console app that was written on c#.

- Checks user login and psw is valid when he tries to loggin;
- If the psw is expired or it's a new user and psw has to be changed during the first loggin - user has an ability to change his psw;
- Shows all the users in the system with the info: Login, Full Name, The Date of Last Loggin;
- The app has a few simple method' helpers and a bunch of exception handlers.
